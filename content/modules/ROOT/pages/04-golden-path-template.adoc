== Golden Path Template

Narrator:  One of the biggest challenges with onboarding a new hire or even simply moving a developer from one team to another is that each codebase often has unique standards.  

You might have heard the phrase "golden path template" and if you were in the Netherlands you might call this concept the "kings road".  The idea is fairly simple though I have to admit it is a challenge to implement.  All the corporate standards can be embodied as code.  You might here this theme a fair bit "as code" and stored in a git repository.

Note: the templates here will be customized by each organization but I want to show you one with some interesting supply chain security capabilities.

Developer: OK, as a new hire, just started on the job 1-hour ago, I have my laptop with my favorite IDE.  I know Java and I know enterprise app development patterns *BUT* I do not know how this organization defines their SDLC, their software development lifecycle.  Every organization designs their path-to-production, their pipelines in unique ways...I really wish to just try something out, to see how the end-to-end works around here.

So I click on *Create* and I remember my boss telling me that this company had an out-of-the-box template.  I am Quarkus developer so I will pick *Securing a Quarkus Service Software Supply Chain* by clicking *Choose*

I see some questions to be answered and I just need to follow the wizard, follow the path laid before me.

I will click on *NEXT STEP*

Narrator: All of these wizard steps, all of these prompts are customizable by your organization.  As a matter of fact, a template is just another set of files in your git repository.  You want to be open to pull requests or merge requests. You want a culture that encourages collaboration and contribution.  Perhaps you have heard of the phrase "Inner Sourcing" recently.   Inner Sourcing is a whole presentation unto itself but for now, let just keep going with our story.

Developer: I remember during the interviews that we discussed that company has been modernizing to containers and Kubernetes.  I remember they said they use the Quay container registry so I will select *Quay*

And take all the defaults.  I will click on *NEXT STEP*

I heard this organization uses Gitlab, I will just take the defaults and click on *NEXT STEP*

Everything looks great, let's just click *CREATE*

Narrator: Now a LOT has happened in the background, for our developer, it was a few simple points and clicks, answer a few questions, all self-service, no tickets, no waiting.  The way this template is configured it requires a code change to kick off the pipeline.
