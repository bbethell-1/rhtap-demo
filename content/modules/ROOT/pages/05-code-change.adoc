== Code Change & Pipeline

As a developer, I want to get into the code so I will click *Source Code Repository*

This opens the GitLab UI for the newly generated repository.

I know what to do with a git repo, I clone it, I change it!

Narrator: There are at least 3 different ways to make a change to this source and and see the SSCS-focused pipeline triggered.  

1. The developer could use the GitLab UI.
2. The developer could use Dev Spaces
3. The developer could use a local IDE on their laptop.

For the purposes of this demonstration, let's try Dev Spaces. 

=== Dev Spaces

Going back to Developer Hub tab, click *Open Component in catalog*

Developer: I saw all the logging fly by and now I am interested in exploring this new software component. 

After I open the Component I can click *OpenShift Dev Spaces (VS Code)*

Narrator: Dev Spaces is a Kubernetes native workspace and IDE capability that is part of the OpenShift platform.  This tool allows your platform team to offer dynamic in-cluster IDE that requires zero configuration and effort by your app developers.

=== Code Exploration

Narrator:  Early when we were exploring the Catalog, you might have been wondering what the magic was, how did the git repo become part of the Catalog?  A key file is called *catalog-info.yaml*

A deeper dive session will be needed to drill-down into this yaml file along with more information on how Backstage Templates execute.  

If you remember, we mentioned the phrase "docs as code" earlier in the session, that is handled as markdown files within the codebase.

Developer: As part of the interview process, I remember that this team described how they like to handle docs.  They leverage the creation of markdown files inside of a *docs* folder within the code repository and the template pre-populated the repository for me.  For now, I am just going to add a wee bit of markdown to see how this shows up later inside the portal. Of course I will come back and create ample documentation because it is just another file inside of my IDE and inside of my repository.

For now, I want to dive into the code *src/main/resources/META-INF/index.html* Let me just make a change where it says "Congratulations".  I will hit Cntrl-F and type "congrat"

I will make this say "Aloha Andrew"

I was hired to be an enterprise Java developer and I know the Quarkus framework, the super fast, super lightweight, optimized for cloud native microservices runtime.   So let's look at that Java code.
