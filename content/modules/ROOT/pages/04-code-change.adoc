== Code Change & Pipeline

As a developer, I want to get into the code so I will click *Source Code Repository*

This opens the GitLab UI for the newly generated repository.

I know what to do with a git repo, I clone it, I change it!

Narrator: There are at least 3 different ways to make a change to this source and and see the SSCS-focused pipeline triggered.  

1. The developer could use the GitLab UI.
2. The developer could use Dev Spaces
3. The developer could use a local IDE on their laptop.

For the purposes of this demonstration, let's try Dev Spaces. 

Going back to Developer Hub tab, click *Open Component in catalog*

Developer: I saw all the logging fly by and now I am interested in exploring this new software component.
